Filters `airports.csv` ( from https://ourairports.com/data/ ) to retain just the large airports.

```{r filter}
read_csv(here('Data', 'airports.csv')) %>% 
  filter(type == 'large_airport' | type == 'medium_airport',
         scheduled_service == 'yes') %>% 
  write_csv(here('ProcData', 'medlarge_airports.csv'))
```
